# Hands-On-Machine-Learning-Study

I compiled my study notes and codes based on the book "Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" written by Aurelien Geron. I write notes as I go through this book. Whatever checked below is the only content available in this repository. If item is not checked, means I am still working on it. Happy studying!
